List of Technologies: For this project I used JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

User Stories:

- Users of this app are going to be people interested in easily accessing a lot of information about a movie. It will most likely be used when someone wants to recall a specific detail of a movie. All a user needs is the name and they can access the majority of pertinent information about that movie.

- Users will eventually be able to add specific movies to a 'favorite movies' array. This way users will be able to save their favorites so if they need info on the fly they can access it both from their desktop browser as well as their mobile device

- I feel like users want to see ample data regarding their searched movie, because not only can they access the actors, but I have also included 4 other individual companies that provide movie reviews. This means one can also use the app to find what the movie is rated, and what its scored in terms of critic ratings

Major Problems or hurdles:

I had trouble getting my eventListener to work properly as I had two event listeners tied to the same element. It took a fairly significant amount of time to solve for a solution that allowed me to fire the API call with one of the clicks of the buttons. It was also a very frusterating debugging process.
